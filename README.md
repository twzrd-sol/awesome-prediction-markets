# Awesome Prediction Markets [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> APIs, datasets, tools, and research for building on prediction markets. For developers and AI agents, not dashboards.

Prediction markets are the best real-time source of calibrated probability for world events. This list focuses on what you need to **build** with that data — APIs to fetch it, tools to process it, datasets to train on, and research to understand it.

Pull requests welcome. See [contributing guidelines](#contributing).

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/spfunctions/awesome-prediction-markets/blob/main/simplefunctions_quickstart.ipynb) — Interactive notebook: world state, market search, trade ideas, contagion detection, and more.

## Quick Start — Get a Price in 30 Seconds

```bash
# Kalshi — what are the markets?

# Polymarket — current markets
curl -s "https://clob.polymarket.com/markets?limit=3" | jq '.[] | {question, tokens[0].price}'

# SimpleFunctions — scan any topic, no auth
curl -s "https://simplefunctions.dev/api/public/scan?q=oil"

# SimpleFunctions — what changed in the last hour
curl -s "https://simplefunctions.dev/api/changes"
